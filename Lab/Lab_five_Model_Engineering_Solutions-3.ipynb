However, often times in practice there are no clear guidelines on how to develop the best model for an application. Suppose we want to build a binary classifier with high recall and precision. How should we proceed if our off-the-shelf model performs poorly on the dataset?\n","\n","In this lab, we will explore a series of techniques for improving your model and features. We will cover seven techniques:\n","\n","- **Model selection**: We can try several different models to see what works best.\n","- **Scaling**: The scale of the values in your data is important\n","- **Feature engineering**: If the existing features aren't useful then we can create new and more relevant features   \n","- **Feature section**: If you have too many features then we can remove some that aren't useful\n","- **Grid Search**: a process for finding a set of good hyper-parameters (e.g., regularization strength)\n","- **Model stacking**: a process where the output from one or more models are input into another.\n","- **Bagging**: a process for combining models that involves combining the outputs from multiple models.\n","\n","Model engineering is more of an art than it is a science. These techniques will work better in some instances than they do in others, and sometimes these techniques can actually make a model perform worse! When you do model engineering it really boils does to doing trial-and-error with these techniques. It is possible to combine these techniques (e.g., do model selection, scaling, and grid search), however, to stop this lab from becoming convoluted you will only combine each technique with model selection.\n","\n","Please keep in mind that these are just a set of possible ways to improve our models. There are many ways to engineer better models, and often the practice of model engineering comes down to the application and our prior experience. We emphasis that in this lab we will largely apply these techniques in isolation, but we encourage you to combine multiple techniques in your project."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"collapsed":false,"id":"Ne5Do4xAIue5"},"source":["## Application\n","This lab will focus on the lending industry, where investors provide loans to borrowers in exchange for the promise of repayment with interest. If the borrower repays the loan, then the lender profits from the interest. However, sometimes the borrower is unable to repay the loan, meaning the lender loses money. The lender in this problem wants to predict if a borrower is unlikely to repay a loan and has asked us to build the best possible prediction model.\n","\n","First, let us import the essential tools."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n"},"id":"hw1OAVAnIue6","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1604262287960,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":469,"user":{"displayName":"Craig Fer","photoUrl":"","userId":"10199331155832657902"}}},"source":["# Standard analytics packages\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","from sklearn.cluster import KMeans\n","from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n","from sklearn.ensemble import VotingClassifier\n","from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_classif\n","# Import models\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression, LogisticRegressionCV\n","# Model evaluation \n","from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score\n","from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\n","# Import model engineering\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n","from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier"],"execution_count":6,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"collapsed":false,"id":"Q-kQo0hEIue-"},"source":["Next, we'll load the dataset for this lab and store it as `df_raw`."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n"},"id":"cLKPAHPZIue-","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1604262288991,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":1486,"user":{"displayName":"Craig Fer","photoUrl":"","userId":"10199331155832657902"}},"outputId":"94a21695-ad5f-4a48-a7d2-6466461295a1","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":215}},"source":["# Import data for lab\n","df_raw = pd.read_csv(\"https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1zj7qSc5mjgXLjQgOfF60PsbO2wupLnTm\")\n","df_raw.head()"],"execution_count":7,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>CreditPolicy</th>\n","      <th>Purpose</th>\n","      <th>IntRate</th>\n","      <th>Installment</th>\n","      <th>Dti</th>\n","      <th>Fico</th>\n","      <th>DaysWithCrLine</th>\n","      <th>RevolBal</th>\n","      <th>RevolUtil</th>\n","      <th>InqLast6mths</th>\n","      <th>Delinq2yrs</th>\n","      <th>PubRec</th>\n","      <th>NotFullyPaid</th>\n","      <th>AnnualInc</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>debt_consolidation</td>\n","      <td>0.1189</td>\n","      <td>829.10</td>\n","      <td>19.48</td>\n","      <td>737</td>\n","      <td>5639.958333</td>\n","      <td>28854</td>\n","      <td>52.1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>85000.000385</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>credit_card</td>\n","      <td>0.1071</td>\n","      <td>228.22</td>\n","      <td>14.29</td>\n","      <td>707</td>\n","      <td>2760.000000</td>\n","      <td>33623</td>\n","      <td>76.7</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>65000.000073</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>debt_consolidation</td>\n","      <td>0.1357</td>\n","      <td>366.86</td>\n","      <td>11.63</td>\n","      <td>682</td>\n","      <td>4710.000000</td>\n","      <td>3511</td>\n","      <td>25.6</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>31999.999943</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>debt_consolidation</td>\n","      <td>0.1008</td>\n","      <td>162.34</td>\n","      <td>8.10</td>\n","      <td>712</td>\n","      <td>2699.958333</td>\n","      <td>33667</td>\n","      <td>73.2</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>85000.000385</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>credit_card</td>\n","      <td>0.1426</td>\n","      <td>102.92</td>\n","      <td>14.97</td>\n","      <td>667</td>\n","      <td>4066.000000</td>\n","      <td>4740</td>\n","      <td>39.5</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>80799.999636</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["   CreditPolicy             Purpose  ...

This is a very important step when features have different orders of magnitude. However, when features values have similar orders of magnitude (like they do now) you may see little to no improvement. The easiest way to standardize data is with the `StandardScaler` function, which is \"fit\" (i.e., calculates the mean and standard deviation) on the training set. Once trained, you should apply it to both the training and validation set before fitting and scoring your model. Note, that we can generally keep binary data ''as is''. Since our target data (whether or not a loan was repaid) is binary, we won't scale the target, which makes the data scaling step a little easier.

When this is the case, you should try to collect better data, however, when better data in unavailable we must do the best with what we have. One option is to create new, strong features that are more useful for predicting the target by transforming and combining weak features (like we did in Lab 1!). This practice is known as feature engineering.\n","\n","Generally, good features have several desirable characteristics, for example, they:\n","*   are spread out evenly (e.g., Gaussian or uniform distributions)\n","*   behave differently (e.g., they may have different means) when the target is different\n","*   are normalized to similar scales.\n","\n","One common technique is to apply logarithms or square roots to features with very large values that follow a distribution with a long tail (e.g., population, income). The problem with distributions that have large values and long tails is that the absolute change in the value of a feature gives less information than the relative change. For example, a 100 dollar difference in income means very different things if you are comparing two low income data points versus two high income data points.\n","\n","We can also \"combine\" features (e.g., add them, multiply them) to make them more useful. When we combine features we can take advantage of *interaction effects* (a concept from statistics), where the interaction of two features together is greater than the sum of the parts. For example, if two features correlate strongly with a target, it is likely that the product of the two features will also correlate. \n","\n","Constructing good features requires experience, domain expertise, and some luck. If you have domain knowledge about your application then you should  think about whether a transformation or a new feature makes sense for the problem, and you should always check that your engineered features are useful for predicting a target. You can generally do anything to create new features. The common tricks include multiplying and/or dividing multiple existing features, however, there are two major rules related to feature engineering:\n","\n","1. Do not create too many features, especially in order to chase marginal increases in correlation. If the correlation is small and your dataset is small, you might be creating fake (dataset-dependent) correlations that wont generalize outside of your data.\n","2.

The best way to go about this is by domain knowledge and developed intuition, however, there are also some tricks to make features without domain knowledge, which will be the focus of this section. \n","\n","An algorithmic way to generate features is provided in the code block below. Where we loop through every pair of features, and multiply them features together (i.e., \"combine\" them). We then evaluate the _usefulness_ of the combined features. There are many metrics for feature selection ([see list of `sklearn` functions here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.feature_selection)). We will use the function `f_classif` to evaluate the  **An**alysis **o**f **Va**riance (ANOVA) F-Value, which is appropriate for estimating how useful a feature is for predicting a categorical target. A higher F-value suggests the feature will be better, and a $p$-value $<$ 0.05 suggests the F-value returned is based on a real trends in the data (i.e., not random chance). \n","\n","For more detail on the ANOVA F-Value you can refer to[this article](https://machinelearningmastery.com/feature-selection-with-numerical-input-data/#:~:text=ANOVA%20f%2Dtest%20Feature%20Selection,-ANOVA%20is%20an&text=The%20ANOVA%20method%20is%20a,as%20an%20ANOVA%20f%2Dtest.&text=The%20results%20of%20this%20test,be%20removed%20from%20the%20dataset).

For example, logistic regression on scikit-learn allows 'L1' or 'L2' regularization, a regularization weight 'C', and additional modifications to the loss function (see [documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) for full list). Decision trees have parameters for depth, loss function, and splitting rules (see [documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html) for full list). \n","\n","When we are tuning a single parameter, the common method is to use k-fold cross-validation and evaluate for which setting does the model perform the best. However, how do we tune 5 or 6 different parameters all at once? The standard method is known as _grid-searching_, where we simply do k-fold cross-validation on all possible combinations of the different parameter values. In grid searching, the practice is to define a specific scoring function, perform a search, and identify an appropriate model. Of course, this approach is computationally expensive, especially when there are a large number of parameters or values to consider. Interestingly, researchers have found that randomly searching the parameter space is often just as effective as grid searching. What this suggests is that there is often no good intuitive way to choose hyperparameters.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"collapsed":false,"id":"JoE9YUcoORdu"},"source":["## Parameter tuning via grid search\n","\n","Scikit-learn provides two useful functions `GridSearchCV()` and `RandomSearchCV()` to implement two approaches towards selecting the hyperparameters. These functions take in a  model, a dictionary of parameters over which to sweep, and a scoring function to evaluate all of the different models on. For each parameter combination, we will run the function with 5-fold cross validation to evaluate each of the scoring functions. Scikit-learn provides a [number of predefined scoring functions](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#scoring-parameter), but you can also make your own.\n","\n","In this section we will do a grid search to find better hyperparameters of the `DecisionTreeClassifier()`.

Model engineering is more of an art than a science. Keep in mind that a method that works really well for one application may not work at all for another.  You can add new components in the stack, grid search to find better parameters of the top model, hunt for new features, and train different models on different subsets of data (e.g., bagging/bootstrap). It's even possible to train your models on the prediction errors of other models (e.g., boosting).
