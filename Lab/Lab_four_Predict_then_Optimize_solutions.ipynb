Since we don't have data on the actual players on the court, we'll use the available data to learn the $\\beta$ values for each physical ability rating. \n",
        "\n",
        "To solve for the $\\beta$ values in $APM_{100}$ calculations, it is common practice to use Ridge regression (i.e., L-2 Regularization, see Lab One for more information). If you are curious as to why we choose Ridge regression, the last few sections of [this blog post](https://squared2020.com/2017/09/18/deep-dive-on-regularized-adjusted-plus-minus-i-introductory-example/) provides the rationale. \n",

        "Note that we will face two major limitations. First, models that use $APM_{100}$ generally suffer from multicollinearity. We will ignore that issue for the sake of brevity, however, it is something you should consider more seriously in your projects. Second, we are violating the general rule of thumb that for a dataset with $N$ samples, we should use no more than $\\sqrt{N}$ features. This is the reality of building models with real world data, it is never perfect!\n",
